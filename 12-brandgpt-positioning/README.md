## What It Does

A positioning framework built with AI assistance to clarify personal brand direction, define the right market lane, and package services in a way that opens opportunities faster. Goes beyond content marketing — the focus is on narrative clarity, service positioning, and making the right prospects immediately understand what value is on offer.

Covers Dutch-market positioning, AI/automation consultant framing, and the connection between personal brand and outreach effectiveness.

## Architecture

```
Positioning audit → lane definition
→ Narrative constructed around real strengths
→ Service packages framed for target buyer
→ LinkedIn profile and outreach copy aligned to narrative
→ Portfolio assets (GitHub, PDF snapshot) reflect positioning
→ Outreach messaging pulls from brand narrative
```

## Key Design Decisions

- Positioning built around real delivered work — not aspirational claims
- Dutch-market context shaped the framing — direct, outcome-focused, no fluff
- Brand narrative feeds directly into outreach messaging tone and structure
- Portfolio and LinkedIn treated as one connected system, not separate assets

## Rebuild-From-Prompt Protocol

**No platform accounts required — this is a strategy and prompt asset.**

**Steps:**
1. Run positioning audit prompt (see `prompts/positioning-audit-prompt.md`)
2. Define lane using lane-definition framework (see `notes/lane-definition.md`)
3. Draft service packaging language
4. Align LinkedIn headline, About section, and Featured content to narrative
5. Pull tone control rules into outreach messaging prompts

## Known Constraints

- Effectiveness depends on consistent application across all outreach and profile touchpoints
