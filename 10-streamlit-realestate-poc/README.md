# 10 — Streamlit Real Estate Intelligence POC

> Locally deployed property analysis interface. Built to validate scraping architecture before committing to production.

**Status:** `POC`
**Stack:** Streamlit · Python · Local deployment
**Tags:** `#poc` `#reporting-dashboard` `#streamlit`

## What It Does

A locally deployed Streamlit interface for property analysis. Built as a proof of concept to test the viability of a scraping and data ingestion architecture before committing to a production build. Explores data ingestion patterns and web-based POC structure for client demonstration.

---

## System Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Streamlit interface | Local property analysis UI |
| Data ingestion | Input layer for property data |
| Scraping architecture | Explored patterns for web data collection |
| POC structure | Lightweight build for client demonstration |

---

## Architecture

```
Property data ingested (manual or scraped)
→ Streamlit interface displays analysis
→ Output used to validate architecture decisions
→ POC demonstrated to client for feedback
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

- Local deployment chosen for POC — avoids hosting costs before validation
- Streamlit chosen for speed of UI build — not intended as the production interface

---

## Rebuild-From-Prompt Protocol

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Python 3.x
- [ ] Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)

**Files in this folder:**
- `notes/` — scraping architecture discussion, data ingestion planning
- `schemas/` — POC structure overview

---

## Known Constraints

- POC only — not production-ready
- Scraping architecture not fully implemented — discussion and planning phase

---

## Iteration Notes

- `2025-01` — POC built and demonstrated
